## Developer Notes

* **Where is the project brief?**  [`../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf`](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf).
* **Making Progress**: We understand this work might be difficult. Also, we understand that your project ideas might not be completely worked out. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will receive specific guidance from your TA and constructive feedback. We are confident that you will succeed!
* **What should be included in the proposal?** Every proposal will be different. It depends on your particular project.  That said, in the table below you will find the expected report elements.  It is important that you engage with and respond to the the Design Brief.
* **How should the proposal be formatted?** You should format your proposal using Markdown in this file. You should aim for a professional presentation - clear, concise, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors.
* **What headings should we use?** As needed, the suggested headings below can be revised and new headings and sub-headings can be added. Please use headings, bullet lists, tables, figures, and other markdown code effectively - seek a professional presentation.
* **Finishing up.** When you are finished writing and formatting your proposal, save these developer notes(they might useful in the future). Then, delete them.
* **Questions?** If you have questions, please ask your TA or post on Teams.

|Abstract | This project uses global food and COVID-19 data to explore the relationship between diet and COVID-19 mortality. Correlations between these two factors could indicate that **(1)** healthy diets improve COVID-19 outcomes, **(2)** countries with enough food are better equipped to combat COVID, or **(3)** a combination of both.|

|1.0 Introduction | Briefly introduce your project. (about 150 words) |
|2.0 Design Situation | <h4>Framing the topic</h4> Before vaccines were widely accessible in the United States, scientists looked to diet as a method to combat COVID-19 [(Chesnut, MacDonald, & Wambier, 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987721000207?casa_token=pHaJP3Rf7TYAAAAA:Guf7-_3zL_U161-6sS7JtyocKkzQcJRU8vZvH4lfdnK84mtpHuXX5PzwT0cBpKQc2lsQTel_ms4). Researchers used COVID-19 mortality in conjunction with food data to find a correlation between country’s diet and COVID-19 mortality rate. While much of this research suggests that “a plant based rich fiber diet… appears to be advantageous” [(Rishi et al., 2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12088-020-00908-0) some researchers argue that countries mortality data cannot be compared because of various collection biases [(Bousquet et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1186/s13601-020-00323-0). While these data collection biases are of concern, “obesity, a risk factor of mortality in COVID-19, suggests the importance of nutrition” [(Bousquet et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1186/s13601-020-00323-0). For this reason, we will investigate diet and COVID-19 by isolating specific food habits and comparing them with COVID-19 mortality. <h4>Human values</h4> These data are connected to international life and health. Every number in this dataset tells a story of public health, agriculture, supply chains, and the industrialization of food. Although each community has a unique cultural relationship with food, all humans require proper nutrition to meet their health needs. When food is commodified, these health needs are compromised in favor of cost, convenience, and accessibility. We acknowledge that dietary choice is a privilege and that the findings of this research are a reflection of systemic issues with dietary health. <h4>Stakeholders</h4>This project consists of governments, farmers, and supply chain managers as direct stakeholders as their actions directly impact the quantity and quality of food distributed to people. Governments are motivated to support population health in order to maintain societal function. Farms and supply chain managers are motivated to allocate food throughout their respective areas. Additionally healthcare workers, schools, high-risk individuals, and all humans are indirect stakeholders as their health and safety are impacted by the direct stakeholders. <h4>Benefits and harms</h4> Analyzing COVID-19 data at a global scale is challenging as “most diseases exhibit large geographical variations which frequently remain unexplained despite abundant research” [(Bousquet et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1186/s13601-020-00323-0). Reactive adoption of diet is not uncommon and “such diets in the long term are unsustainable and can bring adverse side effects to health” [(Khawandanah & Tewfik, 2016)](https://www.inmed.us/wp-content/uploads/4-Fad-Diets-Lifestyle-Promises-and-Health-Challenges.-Journal-of-Food-Research-2016.pdf). However, diet-based issues like obesity have been acknowledged as a “public health threat, with the government failing to reverse this growing trend” [(Khawandanah & Tewfik, 2016)](https://www.inmed.us/wp-content/uploads/4-Fad-Diets-Lifestyle-Promises-and-Health-Challenges.-Journal-of-Food-Research-2016.pdf). Governments, farmers, supply chain managers, and concerned citizens should use this research to structure and support food initiatives that improve population health. |
