|Abstract | This project uses global food and COVID-19 data to explore the relationship between diet and COVID-19 mortality. Correlations between these two factors could indicate that **(1)** healthy diets improve COVID-19 outcomes, **(2)** countries with enough food are better equipped to combat COVID, or **(3)** a combination of both.|

|1.0 Introduction | Briefly introduce your project. (about 150 words) |
|2.0 Design Situation | <h4>Framing the topic</h4> Before vaccines were widely accessible in the United States, scientists looked to diet as a method to combat COVID-19 [(Chesnut, MacDonald, & Wambier, 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987721000207?casa_token=pHaJP3Rf7TYAAAAA:Guf7-_3zL_U161-6sS7JtyocKkzQcJRU8vZvH4lfdnK84mtpHuXX5PzwT0cBpKQc2lsQTel_ms4). Researchers used COVID-19 mortality in conjunction with food data to find a correlation between country’s diet and COVID-19 mortality rate. While much of this research suggests that “a plant based rich fiber diet… appears to be advantageous” [(Rishi et al., 2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12088-020-00908-0) some researchers argue that countries mortality data cannot be compared because of various collection biases [(Bousquet et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1186/s13601-020-00323-0). While these data collection biases are of concern, “obesity, a risk factor of mortality in COVID-19, suggests the importance of nutrition” [(Bousquet et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1186/s13601-020-00323-0). For this reason, we will investigate diet and COVID-19 by isolating specific food habits and comparing them with COVID-19 mortality. <h4>Human values</h4> These data are connected to international life and health. Every number in this dataset tells a story of public health, agriculture, supply chains, and the industrialization of food. Although each community has a unique cultural relationship with food, all humans require proper nutrition to meet their health needs. When food is commodified, these health needs are compromised in favor of cost, convenience, and accessibility. We acknowledge that dietary choice is a privilege and that the findings of this research are a reflection of systemic issues with dietary health. <h4>Stakeholders</h4>This project consists of governments, farmers, and supply chain managers as direct stakeholders as their actions directly impact the quantity and quality of food distributed to people. Governments are motivated to support population health in order to maintain societal function. Farms and supply chain managers are motivated to allocate food throughout their respective areas. Additionally healthcare workers, schools, high-risk individuals, and all humans are indirect stakeholders as their health and safety are impacted by the direct stakeholders. <h4>Benefits and harms</h4> Analyzing COVID-19 data at a global scale is challenging as “most diseases exhibit large geographical variations which frequently remain unexplained despite abundant research” [(Bousquet et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1186/s13601-020-00323-0). Reactive adoption of diet is not uncommon and “such diets in the long term are unsustainable and can bring adverse side effects to health” [(Khawandanah & Tewfik, 2016)](https://www.inmed.us/wp-content/uploads/4-Fad-Diets-Lifestyle-Promises-and-Health-Challenges.-Journal-of-Food-Research-2016.pdf). However, diet-based issues like obesity have been acknowledged as a “public health threat, with the government failing to reverse this growing trend” [(Khawandanah & Tewfik, 2016)](https://www.inmed.us/wp-content/uploads/4-Fad-Diets-Lifestyle-Promises-and-Health-Challenges.-Journal-of-Food-Research-2016.pdf). Governments, farmers, supply chain managers, and concerned citizens should use this research to structure and support food initiatives that improve population health. |
|3.0 Research questions | 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words) |
|4.0 The Dataset | This data set, Food Supply Kcal [(Marila Prata, 2020)] (https://www.kaggle.com/mpwolke/food-supply-kcal/data), represents the global population affected by COVID-19. With this, the data set also accounts for the food supply, nutrition values, obesity percentages, malnourishment percentages, and food habits of the countries represented. Among these broad categories the data set exhibits, variables such as COVID-19 deaths, active cases, and recovery cases are also analyzed. Having these variables allows the correlation between global food habits, and global COVID-19 cases more easily understandable, and also puts the correlation into perspective for the audience of the data. The set excludes the variables race and gender. While excluding these do not change the validity of the data, nor do they compromise the purpose, adding variables such as race and gender, could illustrate any disproportionate infection rates based on these two factors, and if they are affected by different diets. This could also show any commonalities between men’s and women’s diets and which gender tends to have a higher infection rate. The data was amassed by Kaggle user Marila Prata, who collected information from sources like, the Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nations (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) , the Population Reference Bureau (https://www.prb.org/) , the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) , and the USDA center for Nutrition (https://www.choosemyplate.gov/) . The data was originally collected in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been updated since, yet ceased updates in April of 2020. Collecting this data was an attempt at answering the question: what non-pharmaceutical interventions could the population make in order to stop the spread of COVID-19? No funding was involved to collect the data, as the majority of the information is publicly available. Alternatively, those who could benefit, or financially benefit from a data set of this nature would be direct stakeholders such as large healthcare organizations and the government, specifically food and agricultural divisions. The validity of this data is strong. Many of the resources cited come from official United States government websites, and a reputable source, John Hopkins. Besides COVID-19 information collected from Johns Hopkins, there was no data included in the set from a source outside of official, public information. This makes the data easier to trust as it is assumed information that originates from the United States government is honest, and not exclusionary. This data was obtained from Kaggle, an online platform used to publish and find datasets. The source of the data is credited as kaggle, and the aforementioned sources are factual and verifiable. | 
|5.0 Expected Implications |Answers to research questions can have a positive impact on all fronts. For **professional technologists**, the results of the research will allow them to have a more mature and comprehensive concept of nutritional research and they can adjust nutritional balance according to this concept. For **designers**, more concepts about the nutritional content of food allow them to have a more comprehensive theoretical knowledge to think about and apply in practice. Finally, for **policymakers**, the results of nutritional data will allow them to set more rules and requirements for the food industry to ensure people's health for the sake of people's health. Therefore, during COIVD-19 these actions can boost their immunity through nutritional balance so that people have a stronger body to resist the coronavirus. And during a pandemic, the issue of adequate nutritional balance is critical to combating the new coronavirus, and that's something policymakers will consider. |
