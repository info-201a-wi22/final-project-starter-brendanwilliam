## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




##Chart 1 code 
```{r}
Global_Food_Data <- read.csv(".\\final-project-starter-foood\\data\\Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data.csv")

Global_Food_Data <- Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data %>%
group_by(Sugar...Sweeteners) %>%
  filter(Last_Update == max(Last_Update, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  
Global_Food_Data %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = Sugar...Sweeteners, fill = Deaths)) +
  geom_density()
```
## Chart Purpose## 
This density map explores the relationship between global sugar/ sweetener consumption and global Covid-19 deaths. This chart visualizes the ratio of death percentages pertaining to the percentage of sugar consumption

##Observation## 
Observable in the map, there is a clear relationship between percentages of sugar consumption and death percentages.The map exemplifies this by showing that the increase of sweeteners effects the increase in Covid-19 related deaths. 

##Insight##
With this observation, we can see that diets with a higher rate in sugar consumption, can effect a nation/persons susceptibility to Covid-19 exposure and death. 


##Chart 2 code 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source("chart-2.R")
case_deaths
```
## Chart Purpose## 
Considering that the nutritional ratio will have a direct impact on the COVID situation from the perspective of immunity, the purpose of making this graph in the early stage is to count the number of COVID cases and deaths around the world and the ratio between them, so as to compare it with each country. Food nutrient ratios are linked to analyze the impact of nutrition on COVID.
##Observation and Insight## 
According to the scatter plot, in general, almost all countries have a COVID mortality rate below 10%. For some countries with extremely high mortality, such as Belgium(58% death ratio), according to the dataset of Food, the proportion of meat and fruit is far lower than that of countries with low mortality, so it seems that the reason behind this may be because insufficient intake of protein and vitamins leads to decreased immunity.


##Chart 3 code
```{r}
food_global_data <- Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data

obesity_deaths <- food_global_data %>%
  select(Obesity, Deaths)

ggplot(obesity_deaths, aes(x=Obesity, fill = Deaths)) + geom_histogram()
```
## Chart Purpose## 
This histogram explores the relationship between the percentage of global obesity data and the percentages of deaths from COVID-19. Additionally, this chart visualizes the ratio of death percentages compared to the percentage of global obesity. 

##Observation## 
While analyzing the histogram, there seems to be distinct relationship between the obesity data and the COVID-19 related deaths. The increase in obesity appears to affect the increase in COVID-19 death data. 

##Insight##
From these observations, we can see that the higher the obesity data is within a certain region or country, can increase how susceptible a individual is to COVID-19 contraction and death.
