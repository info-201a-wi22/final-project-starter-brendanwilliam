## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




##Chart 1 code 
```{r}
Global_Food_Data <- read.csv(".\\final-project-starter-foood\\data\\Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data.csv")

Global_Food_Data <- Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data %>%
group_by(Sugar...Sweeteners) %>%
  filter(Last_Update == max(Last_Update, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  
Global_Food_Data %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = Sugar...Sweeteners, fill = Deaths)) +
  geom_density()
```

## Chart Purpose## 
This density map explores the relationship between global sugar/ sweetener consumption and global Covid-19 deaths. This chart visualizes the ratio of death percentages pertaining to the percentage of sugar consumption

##Observation## 
Observable in the map, there is a clear relationship between percentages of sugar consumption and death percentages.The map exemplifies this by showing that the increase of sweeteners effects the increase in Covid-19 related deaths. 

##Insight##
With this observation, we can see that diets with a higher rate in sugar consumption, can effect a nation/persons susceptibility to Covid-19 exposure and death. 

##Chart 3 code
```{r}
food_global_data <- Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data

obesity_deaths <- food_global_data %>%
  select(Obesity, Deaths)

ggplot(obesity_deaths, aes(x=Obesity, fill = Deaths)) + geom_histogram()
```
## Chart Purpose## 
This histogram explores the relationship between the percentage of global obesity data and the percentages of deaths from COVID-19. Additionally, this chart visualizes the ratio of death percentages compared to the percentage of global obesity. 

##Observation## 
While analyzing the histogram, there seems to be distinct relationship between the obesity data and the COVID-19 related deaths. The increase in obesity appears to affect the increase in COVID-19 death data. 

##Insight##
From these observations, we can see that the higher the obesity data is within a certain region or country, can increase how susceptible a individual is to COVID-19 contraction and death.
